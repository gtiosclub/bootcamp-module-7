# Module 7: Intro to MVVM and Navigation in SwiftUI

In this module, you'll be building a simple grocery list app from scratch using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and implementing navigation between views.

#### What you'll accomplish:

- [ ] Understand the basics of MVVM architecture
- [ ] Implement a simple MVVM structure in SwiftUI
- [ ] Add navigation between views
- [ ] Create and manage grocery lists using SwiftUI components
- [ ] Add items to your grocery list

## Getting Started

- Open Xcode and create a new SwiftUI project named `SimpleGroceryListApp`.
- Make sure the project is set up correctly and can be run in the simulator.

## Step 0: Understanding MVVM

Before we start coding, let's understand the basic components of MVVM:
- **Model**: Represents the grocery item data and the business logic.
- **View**: Represents the UI.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, managing the state and logic.

In this app, we'll be creating a simple grocery list app to create and manage a list of grocery items.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Model

Create a simple model for the grocery items.

#### What you've accomplished so far:

- [ ] Created a basic model for your grocery items.

## Step 2: Creating the ViewModel

Implement a simple ViewModel to manage the list of grocery items.

#### What you've accomplished so far:

- [ ] Created a ViewModel to manage your grocery items.

## Step 3: Building the List View

Implement the list view to display grocery items using SwiftUI components.

#### What you've accomplished so far:

- [ ] Displayed grocery items using SwiftUI components.
- [ ] Added navigation to create a new grocery list and add items to the list.

## Step 4: Creating the Add Item View

Implement the view to add new items to the grocery list.

#### What you've accomplished so far:

- [ ] Created a view to add new grocery items.

## Step 5: Running the App

Now, run the app in the simulator or preview mode. You should be able to create a grocery list and add items to the list.

## Conclusion

You've just built a simple grocery list app using the MVVM architecture and navigation in SwiftUI!

#### What you've accomplished today:

- [ ] Understand the basics of MVVM architecture.
- [ ] Implement a simple MVVM structure in SwiftUI.
- [ ] Add navigation between views.
- [ ] Create and manage grocery lists using SwiftUI components.
- [ ] Add items to your grocery list.
